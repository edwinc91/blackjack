Technologies Used:

  I used html, css, javascript, and jQuery to create this game.
  
  
 Approach Taken:
 
  I first created a light template in html of what I wanted the page to look like with some rough coloring using css. I then focused primarily on the back-end/javascript portion of my game. After creating a basic functioning code, I didn't have any cards to look at on my page so I had to use the console in Chrome primarily to test and see if my game was actually functioning. After some tinkering and making sure most of the bugs were fixed, I looked online for a sprite of playing cards and added them to my page. Then I went back to the javascript and jquery to make sure all of the interactions worked and that the game was functioning properly. Then, I did some rough designing using CSS.
